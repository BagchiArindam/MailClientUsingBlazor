Simple IMAP/POP3 email client made using ASP.NET Blazor. 
POP3 will not fetch all mail if count is >255. But can be done in batches(Not Implemented). IMAP is superior in this regard.
Only read only retrieval is being done as of current commit.
This is more of an exercise on exercise on Blazor than it is for mail protocols.
For Gmail accounts, normal password will not work, an app password has to be generated from google account settings
